Subject: Request for Token Contract Verification

Dear Tonkeeper Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request verification of the token contract for my project on the TON blockchain. Below are the details of the token:

Token Name: [BeesCoin]

Symbol : Bees  

Contract Address: 
EQAbhSZWmHWv_OfW7M9Mm18y9AXMgoLsgS0AgLs0xY5NkT44

Details of the Project: ["BeeCoin is a Telegram bot-based project expanding into a decentralized platform."]

We aim to ensure transparency and credibility for our community by having our token contract verified on your platform. Please let me know the necessary steps or additional information required to complete this process.

Looking forward to your guidance and assistance.

Best regards,
